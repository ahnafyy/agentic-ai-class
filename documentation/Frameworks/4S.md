**4S: A Method for Crafting Clear and Effective Prompts**

**Single** – Ask the model to do only one thing at a time. Prompts with multiple objectives (e.g., “summarize and critique and translate”) diffuse focus and yield mixed results. Single-focus instructions create more consistent and relevant outputs.

**Short** – Keep the prompt concise and minimal while preserving clarity. Cognitive load theory and token optimization both support brevity: excess verbiage introduces ambiguity and increases processing noise, degrading precision.

**Specific** – Provide explicit details about what you want. Specificity reduces interpretive variance and helps the model constrain its latent search space. For example, “write a two-sentence motivational quote for nurses starting a night shift” is far clearer than “write a motivational quote.”

**Surround** – Embed the task within useful context: define the **role** (who the model is acting as), the **audience**, the **tone**, and the **format**. This contextual framing activates relevant priors within the model and improves alignment with the intended style or domain.

Together, the **4S framework** operationalizes prompt clarity by balancing constraint (Single, Short, Specific) with context (Surround). It’s derived from empirical prompt-engineering studies showing that large language models perform best when goals are narrowly scoped, precisely defined, and contextually grounded rather than over-instructed or under specified.
