**FAIRPAT**

**F – Fairness**
AI systems should treat all individuals equitably and avoid discrimination. Bias must be identified and mitigated in data, algorithms, and outcomes.

**A – Accountability**
Humans, not machines, remain responsible for AI decisions and outcomes. Clear governance, oversight, and mechanisms for redress must be in place.

**I – Inclusiveness**
AI should empower and benefit diverse groups, ensuring accessibility and engagement for everyone, not just the technologically privileged.

**R – Reliability and Safety**
Systems must be rigorously tested for robustness, consistency, and safety under real-world conditions to avoid harmful or unstable behavior.

**P – Privacy and Security**
AI must protect user data, maintain confidentiality, and safeguard against unauthorized access or malicious manipulation.

**A – Accountability (reinforced)**
Accountability is intentionally repeated to emphasize shared responsibility—across developers, deployers, and organizations—for ethical AI operations.

**T – Transparency**
AI systems should be understandable and explainable to users, regulators, and affected parties, fostering informed trust and oversight.
